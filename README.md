Materials for MIT Statistics and Data Science Course

I have uploaded part 1 and part 2 cheat sheets for MITx SDS capstone exam. It doesn't cover all of the material but only the areas, formulas and concepts that I had trouble memorising. You can use them for your own review, although I do recommend to prepare your own, not only because it will be more personalised, but also because you will have the chance to review and internalise the material during the preparation of those cheat sheets.

Disclaimer: I have used these cheat sheets during the October-November 2020 capstone run and they were accepted but I can't guarantee that they will be accepted for the future runs as I can't guarantee the accuracy of the content.
